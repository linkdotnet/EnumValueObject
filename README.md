# EnumValueObject

The EnumValueObject is based on the `ValueObject` class from [here](https://github.com/vkhorikov/CSharpFunctionalExtensions) (credits to: [vkhorikov](https://github.com/vkhorikov)).
This library lets you create strong typed enums, which can only be in a valid state. Furthermore it allows you to define methods on top of your enum and computed property. See the sample section or the quick start tutorial below.
